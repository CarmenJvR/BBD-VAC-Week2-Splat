# BBD Vac Week 2 2021 - Team A

## The problem
- We need a bursary program applicant test.
- Must be fair to all levels of students applying for a bursary.
- Grading should be automatic.
- The test should test logical thought processes and attention to detail.

## Our solution: Splat

Splat is a proof of concept puzzle solving game, that combines colour based puzzle game mechanics with pseudo-code blocks.

For more details on our solution, please take a look at our [presentation](https://github.com/JohannSchepers91/BBD_VW2021_Splat/blob/main/VacWeek2021Presentation.pdf).
